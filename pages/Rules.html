      <p>
        We are a Gaming COMMUNITY. We will always be a community and will always
        try to expand to as many members as possible to try to create a fun
        gaming environment for all. Please do realize that we will always be
        gaining members, and there will be times when you might not know
        everybody. Some people make that out to be a bad thing, but it's a part
        of the gaming community atmosphere. So if you are looking to become a
        NLG Member, you must understand and realize that things will constantly
        be changing in the community. If you don't like the constant growth of
        the community then it might be best to look for a clan to be a part of
        as we look to connect with as many players as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We proudly uphold the right to free speech. Please remember however that
        it is -a right-. We will not sit on our servers and police them for
        people saying bad words. But if people get out of hand we do ask them to
        calm down/stop per the ruleset of the game/service being offered. If
        people join the server/service being offered, and cannot follow our list
        of rules for that server/service on top of using every word known to
        man, then we will kick and/or ban the person who is causing the
        problems. If an issue truly does arise you can always contact an admin
        of that section/service to take care of the situation. There are ways to
        contact us through the servers as well, so please make use of that
        feature.

      <p class="Discipline">
        DISCIPLINE: THERE WILL BE A 2 STRIKE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED. STRIKE 1 WILL
        BE A VERBAL WARNING. STRIKE 2 WILL BE BANNED. WE ARE A COMMUNITY IF YOU
        CANâ€™T FOLLOW RULES AND BE MATURE, WE WILL NOT TOLERATE IT. (ADMINS HAVE
        THE POWER TO BAN ON FIRST OFFENSE.)
      </p>

      <p>
        All staff are in charge of the community. Please do not be afraid to ask
        questions if you have any. We are here as a community and we are all
        looking for an entertaining environment where we don't have to worry
        about trolls ruining it for others. Thank you for taking consideration
        into our community and reading the rules.
